## About

For this project I built a responsive single page website from scratch using vanilla Javascript, CSS and HTML.

## Features

Some features of this website demo include
- Snap scrolling between each page section
- A fixed position menu bar
- A drop down menu for mobile views
- A responsive layout that adjusts based on the window size
- Fading in effects that are triggered when an element appears on screen
- Dynamic scrolling between pages
